Subreddit can be changed easily with a simple variable change. Currently displays subreddits that come up when the current number at that time is searched. Fetches the subreddit's .JSON and recreates it behind the clock.

I have put minimal work in to design/framework besides a focus on google fetch and JSON. Idea is geared toward usability on devices such as chromecast and raspberry pi, so it can easily be put on screen for office or home aesthetics.
